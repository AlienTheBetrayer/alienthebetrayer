# Origins
I began with scripting in Python, Lua, and Ruby, advanced into C, C#, and mastered modern C++ alongside reverse engineering and assembly-level analysis. This deep systems background sharpened my ability to reason about performance, security, and the inner workings of software at every layer. 

# Today's expertise
Today, I apply that expertise to TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind, where I design and implement scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready applications. My approach blends low-level precision with modern architectural practices, resulting in solutions that are both technically robust and elegantly crafted for long-term growth.
