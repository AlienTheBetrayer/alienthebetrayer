# The Beginnings
I began with scripting in **Python, Lua, and Ruby**, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving through small projects and experiments. These early experiences gave me a strong grasp of logic, control flow, and the foundations of software development, while also sparking my interest in understanding how systems really work.

# Low-end mastery
Building on those beginnings, I advanced into **C#** and mastered **modern C and C++**, exploring memory management, performance optimization, and advanced programming paradigms. Alongside this, I studied **Reverse Engineering** and worked directly with **Assembly Language**, which refined a systems-oriented mindset and sharpened my ability to reason about performance, security, and the inner workings of software at every layer.

# Today's Expertise
Today, I apply that expertise to **TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind**, where I design and implement scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready applications, coupled with a strong focus on user experience, leveraging libraries like **Three.js, GSAP and Framer Motion**, while effectively gluing it all together with **Redux and Zustand** libraries. My approach blends low-level precision with modern architectural practices, resulting in solutions that are both technically robust and elegantly crafted for long-term growth.
