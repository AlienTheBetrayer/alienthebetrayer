# Hello
I am a russian self-taught programmer, coding is my hobby and passion. My main languages are C, C++, JS/TS, ASM, but I know Lua and C# as well, I also plan on learning Rust one day. Trying my best to nonstop improve every single day

I like making Discord or sometimes Telegram bots, love to write complex and complicated stuff with C/C++ and occasionally I reverse engineer games, apps and afterwards hack them. If you want to contact me my Discord - Alien#0769, Telegram - @alienthebetrayer.
