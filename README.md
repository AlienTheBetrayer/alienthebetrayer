My path as a developer has been shaped by a progressive immersion into programming at every level of abstraction. I began with scripting languages like Python, Lua, and Ruby, which introduced me to logic and problem-solving. From there, I advanced into the rigor of C and C#, ultimately pushing further into the complexity of modern C++, where I mastered memory management, advanced templates, and performance-critical systems. Along the way, I developed expertise in reverse engineering and disassembly, working directly with assembly language to analyze software at the instruction level. This background instilled in me a precise, systems-oriented mindset — the ability to think critically about performance, security, and the underlying mechanics of computation.

Building on this foundation, I now specialize in TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind, applying the same systems-level rigor to modern web development. My work emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and clarity, resulting in applications that are not only performant but also elegant and resilient. I design with architectural foresight — crafting solutions that balance flexibility and stability, and applying advanced patterns seamlessly under the surface without burdening the user or the codebase. This blend of low-level expertise and modern front-end mastery allows me to deliver professional, enterprise-ready applications that are secure, sustainable, and built for long-term growth.
